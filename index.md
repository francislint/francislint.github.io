## About Me

Hi, I am Tong Lin! I am a second year Ph.D. student at **[UMSI](https://www.si.umich.edu/)**, advised by [Dr. Sabina Tomkins](https://www.travellingscholar.com/). My research interests broadly focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine Learning in Computational Social Science. Specifically, I explore active learning for LLMs, i.e. how LLMs can more effectively generate and support annotations that enhance CSS datasets and research. Iâ€™m also interested in using computational tools to better understand conversations and user behavior on social media.

More about me: I am a desperate cat and dog lover, also a passionate music admirer, a video game enthusiast, a travel lover, a cuisine explorer, a video content creator, a suspense & detective TV series seeker, a(n) (exceptionally amateur) photographer, and a thousand other things.
